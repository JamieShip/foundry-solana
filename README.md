# foundry-solana
A comprehensive toolkit for Solana, built in Rust, designed to simplify and streamline your Solana development experience. It provides a set of tools and utilities to interact with the Solana blockchain, making it easier to build, test, and deploy your Solana projects.

## Installation
To install foundry-solana, run the following command in your terminal:
```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/JamieShip/foundry-solana
```
This will download and install the latest version of foundry-solana from the GitHub repository.

## Quick Start
To get started with foundry-solana, let's take a look at a simple example. Suppose you want to query the status of a transaction on the Solana mainnet. You can use the `castsol` command-line tool to do so. Here's an example:
```shell
castsol tx 35FKJTyf3shma5uQGpS9WaKcmkYaj3MKB2ZLSsYFK1w27hgSNbRxuA1u4Vt6ayLZ1an4aGDRSC6qbvRmVunj3D2A --rpc-url="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
```
This command queries the status of the transaction with the specified signature on the Solana mainnet using the provided RPC URL.
